\section{Introduction}

In the following report we shall outline and describe the algorithms used, their relative theory and the techniques used to implement them in Matlab. The problems this project deals with is the numerical approximate of integrals, solving initial value problems, first and second derivatives and finding zeros values. 

\section{Midpoint Rule}

\section{Euler's Method}

\section{Newtons Method}
Newtons method uses equation of the tangent line to find when a given equation equals zero. To implement this method we used two different approach, the first is a sequential approach where a while loop is used to recalculate $X$ until the stop criteria is met, the second approach uses a recursive function to calculate and re-calculate $x$ until a base-case (stopping criteria) is met. Though the recursive solution is more allegiant does have some serious draw backs such as reaching maximum recursive depth. The following are the results after running the script.

It is easy to see that in both approaches that $x_0 = 2$ coverages quicker. 

\section{First and Second Derivative}
